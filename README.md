# Bike-Rentals-Prediction
A basic regression based neural net is used to predict daily bike rental ridership.

# Wiki contains information on a Public Bike Ridership system (PBS) #
## Preparing the data ##
The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).This dataset has the number of riders for each hour of each day from January 1 2011 to December 31 2012. The number of riders is split between casual and registered, summed up in the cnt column. The model also tries to capture information about the factors affecting the number of riders like temperature, humidity, and windspeed.

NOTE: *Ensure you have numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and jupyter notebook installed in the python 3 environment of Anaconda.*
